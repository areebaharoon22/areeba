								<h3>Jr. Developer Intern (Design and Development dept.)</h3>
								<h5>Cristian Brother Services, Romeoville IL [February 2024 – Present]</h5>
								<p>As the sole developer for the "Monthly Incident Report" project, I designed a relational database from an existing table that required data cleaning, and automated the report generation using Python scripting and macros, integrating graphs and tables into an Excel template. I also wrote Python scripts for data cleaning and small tasks such as finding duplicates and correcting formatting. In a larger project, I collaborated on updating PHP versions for 60+ websites, handling testing responsibilities, updating HTML and PHP sites, and creating test environments on a Linux server. I conducted detailed testing for Jira tickets in preparation for company-wide integration and developed a test plan for a Salesforce-database project, using SQL scripts to ensure data integrity. Additionally, I assisted management with Microsoft products, creating PowerPoint presentations and Excel spreadsheets to support operational tasks.</p>
								<h3>Contract Web Developer</h3>
								<h5>Lewis University (Criminal Justice Department), Romeoville IL [October 2023 – Present]</h5>
								<p>I provided strategic consultation to the professor, offering insights on modern website practices and features to align with the project's goals. Currently, I am leading a comprehensive overhaul of the website’s design, transitioning from an outdated interface to a modernized one. My efforts focus on optimizing performance by reducing load time errors and customizing themes and plug-ins to meet specific functionality needs. Additionally, I implemented a reliable daily backup system using a dedicated plug-in. The project is ongoing, and the progress can be viewed at <a class="my-link-style" href="https://h2i.info" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[h2i.info]</a>.</p>								
								<h3>Research Intern</h3>
								<h5>Lewis University (Security Science Lab), Romeoville IL [November 2023 – February 2024]</h5>
								<p>I collaborated on a team project involving Chatbot GPT, where I was responsible for the front-end development. This included designing and implementing the GUI wireframe, integrating the project into a new server, and deploying the API connection. I also designed and developed the lab's website using WordPress, creating a seamless online presence and advising the professor on selecting an optimal plan based on the site's needs. I researched and implemented suitable WordPress themes, plug-ins, and JavaScript for enhanced functionality. You can view the website at <a class="my-link-style" href="https://sslab.page"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[sslab.page]</a>. Additionally, I wrote weekly reports and attended meetings to actively contribute to various projects.</p>
								<h3>Software Engineer Intern</h3>
								<h5>Armarius Software, Warrenville IL [April 2023 – July 2023]</h5>
								<p>I assisted senior developers with web application projects using ASP .NET Core Framework in C# on Visual Studio, where I created functions to address client needs, including generating and downloading CSV files from databases and filtering page data based on dropdown selections. I also coordinated project workflows within Jira, managing tickets and customizing dashboards to meet project-specific needs. Additionally, I introduced and set up AnyDesk for remote support, conducting training sessions to facilitate collaboration. I worked on several client websites using WordPress with PHP, HTML, CSS, and plugins.
