								<p>How2INFORM focuses on providing media literacy tools and promoting critical thinking to help stop the spread of harmful content online. I took on this project in 2023, and the contract will run until October 2025. Originally created by a group of students in 2021, I have since been updating and redesigning the website to meet the client’s evolving needs. This project holds great significance for me, as I’m passionate about its mission and it has allowed me to further develop my skills independently. I truly enjoy the process of researching and leading a project on my own.</p>

								<p>I worked on this project earlier in 2024, and it taught me how to communicate effectively with the client to fully understand their needs. I completed the project in just two weeks. The website is intentionally simple and basic, as that was its intended purpose. Through this experience, I realized that 'Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication,' a lesson that helped me focus on delivering clear and efficient solutions.</p>
								<h3>Henna by Areeba</h3>
								<h5>View the website: <a class="my-link-style" href="https://hennabyareeba.square.site/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >hennabyareeba.com</a></h5>
								<p>This project is for my part-time business website as a professional henna artist. I needed a site to attract more customers and simplify the booking process. With this in mind, I designed the website from start to finish, allowing my creativity to flourish. It was truly enjoyable to bring my vision to life.</p>
								<h3>Makeup by Ashi</h3>
								<h5>View the website: <a class="my-link-style" href="https://makeup-by-ashi.square.site/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >makeupbyashi.com</a></h5>
								<p>This project was for a friend's business. She needed assistance in establishing an online presence to attract more customers, showcase her work, and increase bookings. The website was initially created by someone else, but after reviewing it, I offered several suggestions that she liked. I then updated her site accordingly. Please take a moment to check out the overall look!</p>
								<h3>IT Champ</h3>
								<h5>View the website: <a class="my-link-style" href="https://myitchamp.square.site/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >myitchamp.com</a></h5>
								<p>This project is quite recent and was for a client seeking to refresh their website's appearance and modify the content to effectively convey their business mission to customers. The website showcases the IT services they provide. It was a valuable experience, as I assisted them not only with the design but also with developing the content.</p>
